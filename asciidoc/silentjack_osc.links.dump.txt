   The program silentjack can be used to listen to JACK ports and detect if
   the audio signal is below or above a defined level (dB) for a defined time
   interval. A fork of silentjack was made in order to sense and control the
   program via the UDP protocol OSC. The library liblo is used to implement
   OSC in silentjack.

   silentjack OSC is a derivate of "silentjack - Silence / Dead Air Detector"

  liblo - Lightweight OSC Implementation

 git clone git://liblo.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/liblo/liblo

   See example programs oscsend and oscdump

   Many applications are possilbe without using the OSC features of
   silentjack simply by using the run command on silence feature.

   However with the OSC modification, silentjack becomes even more powerful.
   Once started, it is a fully controllable network node that does
   inter-process communication (IPC) via OSC.

   It provides a way of reconfiguring running instances of silentjack. As an
   example, the trigger level or silence period of a running silentjack
   instance could be configured by a scheduler. This allows to taylor sensing
   of a source to specific needs based on time (i.e. on a per-radio-show
   basis).

 $ silentjack -h

 silentjack version 0.3 OSC

 Usage: silentjack [options] [COMMAND [ARG]...]
 Options:  -c <port>   Connect to this port
           -n <name>   Name of this client (default 'silentjack')
           -l <db>     Trigger level (default -40 decibels)
           -p <secs>   Period of silence required (default 1 second)
           -d <db>     No-dynamic trigger level (default disabled)

OSC Settings

   The following three settings define how OSC messages are processed.

     * Port to start OSC Server and listen for incoming messages

     * Host and port to send outgoing messages to (report to this address)

   The default settings are

     * Start OSC Server on port 7777

     * Report to 127.0.0.1, port 7778

   Example command line call with alternative OSC settings

   $ silentjack -o 9999 -H 10.10.10.255 -O 10000

        The OSC telling and answering mechanism is different from other       
        implementations                                                       
                                                                              
          * Messages are not sent back to the host and port of the requester  
            by default                                                        
                                                                              
          * There is no pub/sub mechanism and therefore no subscribers list   
   Note     to serve                                                          
                                                                              
        This allows the following scenarios                                   
                                                                              
          * A requesting process can be decoupled from the node that receives 
            the answer                                                        
                                                                              
          * Address of report host can be a broadcast address to serve all on 
            subnet                                                            

   There is a seperate -V (verbose) command line switch for OSC.

   Most of the settings like silence/grace period, trigger level, verboseness
   can be read and set while the program is running via OSC.

Test it

 $ silentjack -n "stream_silence_listener" -l -50 -p 30 -g 60 -V -c "mpg123-6153:left"

   This will start an instance of silentjack in OSC verbose mode (-V) named
   stream_silence_listener (-n) and connect it to output port of mpg123 (-c)
   or any other JACK source of your choice. Since no specific arguments for
   OSC are given, the standard values are used: silentjack will receive
   messages on port 7777, and will report any events or answers to requests
   to localhost, port 7778.

   If the audio level falls below -50 dB (-l) for at least 30 seconds (-p).
   When silence is detected, evaluation will start again after a grace period
   of 60 seconds (-g).

   The oscdump program is an example client of liblo and can be found there.
   It will dump all messages sent by silentjack.

 $ oscdump 7778

   Messages to control a running silentjack can be sent for instance with
   oscsend.

 $ oscsend localhost 7777 /stream_silence_listener/set_trigger_level fs -10 "foo"

  Application Notes

   In order to detect a faulty audio signal in means of a missing left or
   right channel, use two instances of silentjack, one per channel.

   silentjack can be used for any audio routing logic that depends on
   available / not available signals in an automatic way, for instance to
   drive fade-in / fade-out by precedence rules over an array of inputs.
